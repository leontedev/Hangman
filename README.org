* Riddle Hangman
Challenge 3 - Day 41 - https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

Make a hangman game using UIKit. As a reminder, this means choosing a random word from a list of possibilities, but presenting it to the user as a series of underscores. So, if your word was “RHYTHM” the user would see “??????”.
The user can then guess letters one at a time: if they guess a letter that it’s in the word, e.g. H, it gets revealed to make “?H??H?”; if they guess an incorrect letter, they inch closer to death. If they seven incorrect answers they lose, but if they manage to spell the full word before that they win.

** Solution
 - Autolayout in code.
 - UITextField Delegate shouldChangeCharactersIn - to restrict keys to letters only.
 - String Extension to replace a Character in a String at an inde:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
extension String {
    func replace(_ with: String, at index: Int) -> String {
        var modifiedString = String()
        for (i, char) in self.enumerated() {
            modifiedString += String((i == index) ? with : String(char))
        }
        return modifiedString
    }
}
#+END_SRC

 - Property Observers for updating the UI Labels: retries left and tried letters.
